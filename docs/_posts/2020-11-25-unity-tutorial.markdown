I'm trying out unity, in preparation for helping write puzzles in a hackathon. In short this meant trying out a tutorial on the unity site:

  [learn.unity.com/course/create-with-code][create-with-code]

It's geared for absolute beginners in Unity and programming, so the coding was very basic, but I found it a good way to experience pieces of the editor in a slow roll out.

Locally in jekyll this works - I can link to the project and it will run.
