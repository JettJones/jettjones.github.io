I was reminded when linking to [The Game on wikipedia][the-game] that the worldhenchmen.org site has been down for a bit.  I really like my cryptic crossword in the application, so I set about reviving a copy from the game supplies.

  [World Henchmen Organization backup][world-henchmen]

Tweaks and learnings

* The github hosted version of this site is very particular about capitialized / non-capitalized paths, while local jekyll doesn't seem to care

* CSS :hover is much easier than what we were doing for buttons before

* Jekyll templates might pull out the common header and sidebar on all these pages.  Maybe another project

* Most of the videos are still up! Sadly not snake on rye though ( "you're welcome citizens of the world" )
